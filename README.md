## R PACKAGE VIGNETTE COUNTS.
Data from Dr Robert Flight.

The goal of this project is to analyze the changes in the number of vignettes over time, ideally to quantify the effect of knitr and rmarkdown.

I created a personal CRAN mirror and cloned all available Bioconductor git repos on 2021-10-09. For each current and available package under the CRAN archive, I counted how many sweave and markdown vignettes were present. For Bioconductor, I counted how many of each vignette type was present at each commit.

The RDS files with this data are in:

Bioconductor
